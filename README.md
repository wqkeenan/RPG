# Unciv-mod-example

A Dungeons & Dragons mod for UnCiv.

Play as one of the Lords of the free cities of the Sword Coast. To survive in this monster plagued land you must marshal not only your armies but recruit bands of heroes to clear dungeons and defeat monsters. 

Adventurers beat monsters, monsters beat armies, and armies beat adventurers.
